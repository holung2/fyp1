[SCENE-1] A blonde-haired, horned character with a menacing aura is preparing to attack, glowing with energy. The orange-haired girl in a simple outfit panics, raising her hand in a "stop" gesture, as if trying to negotiate or signal a truce. A speech bubble with a hand symbol reinforces her intention.

[SCENE-2] A green-haired character wearing a top hat and cape suddenly appears behind the orange-haired girl, pulling her back forcefully. The orange-haired girl looks surprised and nervous, seemingly unsure of what’s happening.

[SCENE-3] The orange-haired girl, now sweating, awkwardly smiles while holding a small gold coin in her hand. She appears to be attempting a peace offering, possibly as a bribe or distraction.

[SCENE-4] The horned character, still glowing with an ominous aura, furiously slaps away the orange-haired girl’s hand, rejecting the coin. The orange-haired girl recoils in shock, clearly realizing that her plan has completely failed. The humor in this comic comes from the absurdity of trying to bribe a powerful, angry opponent with a single coin, only to be met with outright rejection.
