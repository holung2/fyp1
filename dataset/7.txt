[SCENE-1] A silver-haired character is hiding inside a trash can, with only their head sticking out, looking nervous. A dark-haired character wearing a futuristic outfit looks at them with an exasperated expression as if they are dealing with something ridiculous.

[SCENE-2] The dark-haired character turns slightly away, seemingly ignoring the situation. The silver-haired character peeks out from the trash can, tilting their head with a curious expression, as if trying to see if they are still being watched.

[SCENE-3] Suddenly, the silver-haired character enthusiastically lifts a miniature trash can, presenting it like a grand reveal. Their eyes shine with excitement, as if they are extremely proud of their discovery. The text beside them says "ジャーン" (Tada~), emphasizing their excitement.

[SCENE-4] The dark-haired character, now completely unimpressed, quietly picks up the miniature trash can (with the silver-haired character still inside) and holds it in one hand like an accessory. The silver-haired character remains inside, with small sparkles floating around them, still committed to their trash can antics. The scene ends with a comedic contrast between their enthusiasm and the other character’s deadpan reaction.
