[SCENE-1] A girl with glasses and animal-like ears is looking up dreamily, appearing to be lost in thought or admiration. The background is bright and clear, suggesting a peaceful outdoor setting.

[SCENE-2] Another girl with orange hair, also with animal-like ears, is shown with a thoughtful expression while holding her chin, seemingly considering or processing something.

[SCENE-3] The two girls from the previous panels are now together, engaging in conversation. The girl with glasses continues speaking with a confident and cheerful expression, while the orange-haired girl listens intently, still deep in thought.

[SCENE-4] A red-haired girl with bright green eyes suddenly appears with a completely shocked and confused expression. A large "!?!" appears next to her, emphasizing her bewilderment. The humor in the comic comes from the fact that whatever the two girls were discussing must have been so unexpected or nonsensical that it left the red-haired girl utterly stunned.
