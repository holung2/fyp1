[SCENE-1] A girl with green hair sits on a brown couch, sipping tea from a cup. Surrounding her on the table and couch are several small doll-like figures with blonde hair and red ribbons, neatly arranged. The atmosphere is calm as she enjoys her tea, seemingly unbothered by the unusual presence of the dolls.

[SCENE-2] A blonde-haired girl in a blue dress with a red ribbon stands nearby, looking at the green-haired girl with a curious expression. The green-haired girl, still holding her cup, looks back in mild surprise. The small dolls remain in place, creating an odd yet whimsical scene of stillness and observation.

[SCENE-3] The blonde-haired girl dramatically reveals two large wooden suitcases, each filled with even more identical dolls. The green-haired girl stares, wide-eyed, a question mark floating above her head, as if trying to process what she is witnessing. The sudden escalation adds a comedic tension.

[SCENE-4] The blonde-haired girl, now at the doorway, excitedly holds up more dolls as if presenting them as a gift. The green-haired girl, still seated, is in complete shock, clutching her tea cup tightly while a paper with exclamation marks flies from her hand. The sheer overwhelming number of dolls turns the situation from amusing to absurd.
