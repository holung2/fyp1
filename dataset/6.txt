[SCENE-1] A silver-haired girl and a gray-haired boy pose together against a colorful background filled with stars. The girl makes a peace sign while holding a small plush toy, winking playfully. The boy, standing beside her, maintains a calm expression and gives a thumbs-up. They appear to be taking a fun photo together.

[SCENE-2] The girl changes her appearance slightly, now wearing a black hat and sunglasses. She tilts her glasses down slightly with a confident smirk, as if trying to look cooler. The boy, however, remains completely unchanged, still giving a thumbs-up with the same neutral expression.

[SCENE-3] The girl continues altering her look, now enthusiastically holding a bottle of orange soda while laughing joyfully. She appears excited and energetic. Meanwhile, the boy remains exactly the same, still giving his thumbs-up with an unchanged neutral expression.

[SCENE-4] The girl, seemingly out of ideas, turns her head slightly toward the boy with a blank expression, as if realizing that no matter what she does, he wonâ€™t react differently. The boy, unfazed, keeps his signature thumbs-up and neutral face. The comedic contrast between her dynamic changes and his unwavering pose makes the scene humorous.
