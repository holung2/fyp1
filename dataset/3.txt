[SCENE-1] A white-haired elf girl cautiously approaches a large red and gold treasure chest, inspecting it closely with a suspicious expression. Another character, a smaller figure with silver hair, stands nearby, also observing the chest with curiosity. The scene is filled with tension as they examine the potential prize.

[SCENE-2] The elf girl stands upright, now deep in thought, her hand on her chin as she contemplates the situation. Beside her, a purple-haired girl dressed in black stands motionless, her expression neutral as if waiting for the elf girl to make a decision. The atmosphere feels contemplative yet uncertain.

[SCENE-3] The elf girl remains in the same thoughtful pose, staring intently at the chest, while the purple-haired girl continues to stand beside her, expression unchanged. The stillness of the moment stretches, emphasizing the elf girl's internal debate.

[SCENE-4] Suddenly, the elf girl makes up her mind, clenching her fists with determination and preparing to charge forward. However, before she can move, the purple-haired girl firmly grabs her arm, stopping her from acting impulsively. The contrast between the elf girl's eagerness and the purple-haired girl's calm restraint creates a humorous yet suspenseful conclusion.
