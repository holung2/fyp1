[SCENE-1] A black-haired girl in a school uniform enters a room and notices a beautifully designed sword on display. She recalls an image of a blonde-haired girl holding the same sword confidently, inspiring admiration.

[SCENE-2] The black-haired girl, seemingly impressed by the sword, picks it up and starts practicing with it. She strikes a pose, trying to mimic the blonde-haired girl’s stance, looking serious and focused.

[SCENE-3] The blonde-haired girl, along with a few other students, walks into the room and sees the black-haired girl mid-practice. The black-haired girl, caught in the moment, smiles smugly, feeling proud of herself.

[SCENE-4] The blonde-haired girl looks shocked and raises her hand as if to yell "STOP!" However, it's too late—the black-haired girl has already dropped to one knee, dramatically pledging herself to the sword. The scene is humorous because she takes the moment way too seriously, much to the surprise of the onlookers.
