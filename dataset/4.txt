[SCENE-1] A close-up of a handheld device screen displays a navigation map with two character icons, one with white hair and the other with red hair, positioned on a small island. A red line traces the route taken. A hand holds the device, showing that someone is tracking their location. The text "一周后..." (One week later...) indicates the passage of time.

[SCENE-2] A purple-haired character wearing glasses and an orange life vest leans over the side of a boat, looking at the device with a tense expression. The boat sails across the ocean, leaving a white foamy trail behind as seagulls fly in the background. The scene conveys urgency and concern.

[SCENE-3] A close-up of the purple-haired character's face reveals beads of sweat and a blank, almost horrified expression. Their glasses are slightly askew, and they appear to be processing something shocking as they stare ahead. The tension builds as they approach their destination.

[SCENE-4] On the island, two disheveled characters sit in the sand wearing makeshift grass skirts. The white-haired character sluggishly chews on food, holding a makeshift wand. Meanwhile, the red-haired character is engulfed in flames, radiating an intense aura with a glowing emblem on their chest. The contrast between their conditions and the rescuer’s reaction adds comedic absurdity to the scene.
