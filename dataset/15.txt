[SCENE-1] A blue-haired character with a hat and elegant outfit is smiling with excitement, surrounded by confetti. It appears to be a special occasion, likely their birthday, and they are eagerly anticipating gifts.

[SCENE-2] The blue-haired character excitedly holds up a tabletop game as a gift, looking delighted. The gift givers, a well-dressed person with a feathered hat and another wearing sunglasses with a hat, watch calmly as they present the gift.

[SCENE-3] The blue-haired character is surprised to see another gift—a cake with a dramatic, dark, and ominous-looking sword stabbed into it. The gift comes from a man in a top hat and a cat-eared character, who seem pleased with their choice.

[SCENE-4] The blue-haired character is now sweating profusely upon receiving another unexpected gift: a collection of bottled hot spring or spa water from different regions. The final gift giver, a refined-looking character with blue horns, presents the bottles with a proud expression.

The humor in this comic comes from the increasingly bizarre and unexpected nature of the gifts, contrasting with the blue-haired character’s initial excitement and growing bewilderment.
