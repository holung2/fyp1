[SCENE-1] A green-haired girl with a key-like hair accessory excitedly greets a brown-haired girl with raccoon-like ears and tail, who has just arrived with a blue-haired character. They appear to be at the entrance of a traditional-looking house.

[SCENE-2] The green-haired girl enthusiastically gestures towards the brown-haired girl, seemingly asking for something. She has a happy expression, and there is a thought bubble showing a bowl of rice, suggesting she is asking for food. The brown-haired girl looks a little confused but amused.

[SCENE-3] Inside the house, a pink-haired girl wearing a maid-like hat is seen from the back, facing the entrance where the previous characters are now inside. The brown-haired girl and the green-haired girl can be seen in the background, preparing to enter.

[SCENE-4] The brown-haired girl joyfully welcomes a new characterâ€”an orange-haired girl wearing a blue apron and carrying a tray filled with food and drinks. The orange-haired girl appears overwhelmed, sweating and struggling to carry the tray, while the brown-haired girl laughs happily. The humor comes from the fact that instead of the brown-haired girl providing food, she brought someone else to serve it, much to the surprise and distress of the new character.
