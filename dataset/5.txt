[SCENE-1] A blue-haired girl with a floating halo above her head stands confidently, preparing to step onto a weighing scale. She appears calm and composed as she looks down at the scale.

[SCENE-2] She notices the scale displaying "50 kg" and seems satisfied. However, she remains observant, as if something is off.

[SCENE-3] Suddenly, the scale's display changes to "100 kg," causing the girl to panic. She looks down at the scale in shock, sweat forming on her face as she tries to comprehend what just happened.

[SCENE-4] The perspective shifts downward, revealing a red-haired girl hiding below the platform, pulling a rope attached to the blue-haired girlâ€™s legs. She struggles as she tugs, explaining the sudden weight increase. The scene humorously reveals the prank being played.
