[SCENE-1] A large, ornate treasure chest with red and gold detailing sits in the center, gleaming under the light. Small sparkles surround it, emphasizing its allure and mystery, as if inviting someone to open it.

[SCENE-2] A white-haired elf girl with bright green eyes clenches her fists with excitement, ready to rush toward the chest. However, a purple-haired girl in a black outfit holds onto her arm, preventing her from moving forward. The elf girl looks determined, while the purple-haired girl remains calm and composed.

[SCENE-3] The purple-haired girl raises a hand and points toward the chest while a speech bubble appears beside her, depicting the same treasure chest but with sharp, monstrous teeth inside. The elf girl pauses, her determined expression shifting slightly as she processes this warning.

[SCENE-4] The treasure chest remains in place, still sparkling innocently. The elf girl, now cautious, gazes at it with a skeptical expression, her excitement replaced by hesitation as she considers whether it's truly a prize or a hidden danger.
