[SCENE-1] A small, isolated island is shown in the middle of the ocean. The island has a few palm trees, some scattered rocks, and remnants of wreckage floating nearby, suggesting that someone has been stranded there. The scene sets up a survival situation.  

[SCENE-2] Two characters, a red-haired girl and a white-haired girl, sit on the beach in a disheveled state. They are covered in seaweed and have starfish stuck to their hair. The white-haired girl looks completely exhausted, with a blank, drained expression and water dripping from her mouth, while the red-haired girl looks slightly more composed but still worn out. The white-haired girl weakly points at a broken piece of a boat, indicating their dire situation.  

[SCENE-3] The white-haired girl starts panicking, shaking and crying comically as she realizes the severity of their predicament. The red-haired girl, however, remains calm and even appears somewhat amused by her companionâ€™s exaggerated reaction.  

[SCENE-4] The red-haired girl smirks confidently and gives a thumbs-up while imagining survival essentials: a campfire, a cup of water, and a fish wrapped in a leaf. She seems optimistic about their chances of survival, despite the circumstances, in contrast to the white-haired girl's despair. The humor comes from the stark contrast between their attitudes toward the situation.
