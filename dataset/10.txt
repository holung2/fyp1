[SCENE-1] A purple-haired woman, dressed in elegant and ornate clothing, holds a small maraca and shakes it with a neutral expression. The background is bright and soft, giving a peaceful atmosphere.  

[SCENE-2] A dark-haired man in a black and white outfit looks at her with a confused and slightly unimpressed expression. He seems to be trying to process what he is seeing.  

[SCENE-3] The woman continues shaking the maraca, but now with a glowing, radiant background. At the same time, she holds a **small chibi version of herself** in her other hand, making the situation even more bizarre.  

[SCENE-4] The man’s expression shifts dramatically to one of shock and disbelief, his eyes widening, mouth slightly open, and sweat forming as he stares at the surreal scene. The humor comes from the contrast between the woman’s calm demeanor and the man’s increasing confusion and horror at the absurdity of the situation.
